Itemgetter creates a function that, when given an iterable (like a list or tuple), returns the item at index n of that iterable.
we could also use lambda
itemgetter can be slightly more efficient than using a lambda because it is a built-in function designed specifically for item retrieval, while lambda functions require more overhead to define and call.
